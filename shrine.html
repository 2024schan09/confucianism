			Rituals is a crucial concept in Confucianism. Confucius himself fully emphasized the importance of following old traditions and rituals. However, even with the decline of Confucianism and the rise of Neo-Confucianism, the presence of rituals remained prominent in China. As Neo-Confucianism spread to neighbouring countries Korea and Japan, the tradition of ritual practices followed, which is why many of the objects sitting in this virtual shrine room were created from regions other than China. It is evident how influential Confucian ideas were to different countries, in fact, many Confucian-rooted practices can still be seen today.
			<p> The virtual shrine can also be called the offering hall, where one of the most important rituals is practiced, ancestral worship. It is believed that worshipping and offering food to ancestors would in turn provide benefits and blessings to the descendants. Even the idea of social hierarchy is present in ancestral worship. It is important that the shrine room is located as the central part of the house as it is the most sacred room.

			<p> Confucius believed that “it is better to be cautious than to be whimsical. And as is said in the Book of Li, great pleasure must be of ease and great aesthetic living must be of simplicity.” The incense stand in this room may not look like a Confucian piece but its simplistic structural design falls under the traditional Confucian aesthetic. Like the furniture placed in other rooms of the house, the stand is upright, balanced, and symmetrical. It is another furniture piece to remind us of the important gentleman qualities one was expected to have in a Confucian society. </p>

		Many different objects were used to facilitate ancestral worship, such as the items above. Their simple design was heavily influenced by Confucian aesthetics, but the white color was a new artistic feature added by the Koreans during the Choson Dynasty. Read more about these specific objects in Part III: Confucian Craft in the Choson Dynasty. <br> <br>
