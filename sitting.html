			The virtual sitting area contains various objects that constantly reminds people of the important human qualities a ‘gentleman’ must have.
			An ideal gentleman is expected to loyal to the king and serve the government. They must be virtuous, righteous, honest, humane, and filial. The king himself must also be a gentleman and have the ability to influence his people by moral example.

		<h4> Uprightness Chairs </h4>

		<div class="caption"> Pair of chairs, China, 17th century, Huanghuali wood. The material of the chairs as well as their straight form hold are premised on Confucious cultural norms and notions of uprightness. </div>
	</div>
	<div class="main-content">
		<p> The straight form of these chairs is a reminder of the Confucian ideas on uprightness. Confucius believed that uprightness is an important quality for a ruler to have. To be able to maintain an orderly state, a ruler must be upright and direct with orders even if one is at fault. If a ruler fails to do so, he is not a ‘true gentleman’ and the state will fall into disorder. </p>

	<div class="caption">Plum Blossom Vase (maebyeong) with dragon and chrysanthemum florets. Joseon dynasty, early 15th century. Buncheong stoneware. Example of the adoption of Chinese aesthetics and Confucian modest design on Choson Korea. </div>
	<div class="main-content">
		<p> Plum blossoms symbolizes virtue, which is described as “power” within one’s self and moral worthiness. In the Shang, it was believed to be power that a ruler received after winning the blessings from the ancestral spirits. In the Zhou, it was seen as a gift from Heaven for proper ritual conduct. Confucius believed that anyone who is true to the Way can attain Virtue. </p>
		<p> The Five Virtues of Confucianism are: 1. Benevolence 仁 (ren) 2. Righteousness 義 (yi) 3. Trustworthiness 信 (xin) 4. Propriety 禮(li) 5. Wisdom 智(zhi). Although created during Korea’s Choson Dynasty, the influence of Confucianism outside of China is evident. </p>
