		  Here in the bedroom of the Confucian house, most of the furniture is built with a cuboid shape. It represents the emphasis on uprightness and obtaining Dao, the moral Way.
			These furniture are structured to be upright, balanced, symmetrical, and importantly, cuboid. If a piece is not cuboid, it will fail to satisfy uprightness and stability. Therefore, a gentleman “should pursue uprightness, regularity, and stability to obtain the body of the Dao. ‘In the universe, what’s central, upright, and regular are good; and what are eccentric, oblique, and partial are bad.’”. In having a large, spatial furniture to rest, a gentleman can remain upright, and “his mind rests at where it should rest. ‘The great man is steadfast and peaceful. “He who is steadfast and peaceful is a sage.”’<sup>1</sup> <br> <br>

		While it may seem redundant to place two types of beds in one room, the couch bed can be used as an additional sitting or resting place in the room. As mentioned earlier, a gentleman should have a large space to rest. It would allow his mind to rest and be at peace. Once he reaches a peaceful state, he can easily maintain uprightness, follow the five Virtues, and pursue the moral Way. As with the rest of the furniture in the house, the structural design of the furniture in the bedroom remain consistent: it is symmetrical, upright, and even. <br> <br>
